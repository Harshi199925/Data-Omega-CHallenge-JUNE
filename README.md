# Data-Omega-CHallenge-JUNE-2022
Contains Power BI dashboard on LQBTQ community survey
Data Omega is a Data Analytics and BI solutions company which organised a Data Challenge for the month of June, 2022. To celebrate pride month, the dataset was based on a survey conducted in 23 European countries. The aim of the survey was to identify how lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people living in the European Union and Croatia experience the fulfilment of their fundamental rights. 

The task was to use this survey data and make a single page Dashboard.
I used Power BI to analyse and visualize the data.
